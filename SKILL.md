# Dreamer-Realist-Critic

Structured creative problem-solving using Walt Disney's three-room methodology: separate imagination, practical planning, and critical evaluation into distinct phases that don't contaminate each other.

---

## When to Use

- Developing a new product, feature, or project
- Brainstorming sessions that get stuck mixing ideas with objections
- Creative problem-solving where wild ideas are needed
- Strategic planning that needs both vision and grounding
- Team ideation where critics kill ideas too early
- Any situation where "yes, but..." is blocking progress

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| challenge | Yes | The problem, opportunity, or project to develop |
| existing_ideas | No | Any ideas already generated |
| constraints | No | Known constraints (will be ignored in Dreamer phase) |
| goal | No | Desired outcome or success criteria |

## The Disney Three-Room Method

### Critical Rule: Never Mix the Rooms

Each thinking mode has its time. The Dreamer doesn't worry about budgets. The Realist doesn't dream. The Critic doesn't create. Mixing them kills both creativity and execution.

"There were actually three different Walts: the dreamer, the realist, and the spoiler. You never knew which one was coming to the meeting."

---

## Phase 1: The Dreamer Room

**Mindset:** Pure possibility. No limits. What would be wonderful?

**Questions to ask:**
- What if anything were possible?
- What would we create if we had unlimited resources?
- What's the most magical version of this?
- What would delight people beyond their expectations?
- What has never been done before?
- What would we attempt if we knew we couldn't fail?

**Rules:**
- NO constraints, budgets, or "but how" questions
- NO evaluation or criticism
- EVERY idea gets captured, no matter how wild
- Build on ideas with "Yes, and..."
- Quantity over quality - volume matters
- Reach for the impossible

**Output:** A vision of what could be at its most wonderful

---

## Phase 2: The Realist Room

**Mindset:** Practical pathway. How could we actually make this work?

**Questions to ask:**
- How would we build this?
- What would it take? What resources, people, time?
- What's the sequence of steps?
- What existing capabilities can we leverage?
- What would we need to learn or create?
- What's the path from here to there?

**Rules:**
- Focus ONLY on "how" - not "whether"
- Don't kill ideas, find ways to make them work
- Break big dreams into actionable steps
- Identify dependencies and sequences
- Be creative about solutions to obstacles
- This is problem-solving, not problem-finding

**Output:** A practical plan to realize the Dreamer's vision

---

## Phase 3: The Critic Room (The "Sweat Box")

**Mindset:** Constructive stress-testing. What could go wrong? How do we make this bulletproof?

**Questions to ask:**
- What are the risks and vulnerabilities?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What could cause this to fail?
- What are we missing?
- What would our competitors say?
- What would skeptics point out?

**Rules:**
- Criticize to STRENGTHEN, not to kill
- Every critique must come with a mitigation or question to resolve
- Don't re-open the Dreamer phase - work with the vision you have
- Identify specific vulnerabilities, not general doubt
- The goal is to make the plan stronger, not to abandon it
- If the dream must fundamentally change, return to the Dreamer room explicitly

**Output:** Strengthened plan with risks identified and mitigations proposed

---

## Process

### Step 1: Set Up the Rooms (Metaphorically)

Explicitly announce which room you're in. If working with a team, physically move or change context. The psychological separation matters.

### Step 2: Dreamer Session

Spend adequate time in pure imagination. Don't rush to the Realist. The Dreamer room is where magic is born.

**Duration guide:** At least 30% of total time

### Step 3: Realist Session

Take the Dreamer's vision and build a path to it. Resist the urge to scale back - find ways forward.

**Duration guide:** At least 40% of total time

### Step 4: Critic Session

Stress-test the plan. Be rigorous but constructive. Every problem identified should have a potential solution or research question attached.

**Duration guide:** At least 30% of total time

### Step 5: Integration

Synthesize the three phases into a refined vision with a practical plan and addressed vulnerabilities.

| [Risk 1] | [How to address] |
| [Risk 2] | [How to address] |

**Assumptions to Validate:**
1. [Assumption 1] - [How to test]
2. [Assumption 2] - [How to test]

### Integrated Synthesis
[The refined vision with practical grounding and risk mitigation]

**The Vision:** [What we're building]
**The Path:** [How we get there]
**The Safeguards:** [What protects us]
```

---

## Constraints

- Never skip the Dreamer phase - it's where differentiation lives
- Never let the Critic into the Dreamer room - ideas need space to develop
- Never let the Dreamer dismiss Realist concerns - execution matters
- The Critic serves the dream, not their own ego
- If rooms get mixed, stop and reset explicitly
- Some ideas need multiple cycles through all three rooms

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Dreamer produces nothing wild | Push harder - "What if physics didn't apply?" "What would Disney do?" |
| Realist says "impossible" | That's Critic thinking - return to "how could we?" |
| Critic kills the dream | Critic must propose alternative or mitigation, not just object |
| Rooms get mixed | Pause, explicitly name current room, restart that phase |
| Team can't switch modes | Change physical location or take a break between phases |

---

## Outputs

## Example

**Input:** "We need to improve our new employee onboarding. Currently it's a boring 2-hour presentation followed by paperwork."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Dreamer-Realist-Critic Analysis: New Employee Onboarding

### The Dreamer's Vision

What if onboarding felt like the first day at Disneyland, not the first day at the DMV?

**Wild Ideas Generated:**
1. Each new hire gets a "guide" character who appears throughout their first 90 days with personalized messages
2. The first day is an adventure through the company - physically visiting teams, collecting "stamps" in a passport
3. Instead of presentations, new hires solve a mystery that teaches them about the company while they investigate
4. Virtual reality time travel through company history, meeting founders and key moments
5. "Choose your own adventure" onboarding where they select what to learn based on curiosity
6. A welcome video from the CEO that's actually a musical number
7. Their desk/workspace is decorated by their new team before they arrive, based on their interests from the hiring process

**The Dream:** Onboarding as an immersive adventure where new hires feel like the hero of their own story joining an exciting journey, ending day one feeling they've made the best decision of their career.

### The Realist's Plan

Taking the adventure/passport concept as most feasible:

**Key Steps:**
1. Design "Journey Passport" with stations at 6-8 key teams/locations
2. Create 10-minute interactive experiences at each station (not presentations)
3. Build digital companion that guides via mobile, tracks progress
4. Develop "welcome kit" with personalized elements based on hire data
5. Train station hosts to deliver engaging mini-experiences
6. Create celebration moment when passport is complete

**Resources Needed:**
- Design: 2 weeks for passport and materials
- Engineering: 3 weeks for mobile companion app
- Training: 4 hours per station host
- Budget: ~$50 per new hire for physical materials

**Timeline/Sequence:**
Week 1-2: Design passport journey and station experiences
Week 3-4: Build mobile companion, train hosts
Week 5: Pilot with 5 new hires
Week 6: Iterate based on feedback
Week 7+: Roll out

### The Critic's Stress-Test

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Station hosts too busy/inconsistent | Create backup video experiences; incentivize hosting |
| Takes longer than current 2 hours | Design for 4 hours; distributed across first week if needed |
| Feels gimmicky to some new hires | Offer "express track" option; substance behind the format |
| Scales poorly with large cohorts | Stagger start times; parallel stations; cohort limits |
| Remote employees excluded | Build parallel virtual journey with video stations |

**Assumptions to Validate:**
1. New hires want more engaging onboarding - [survey recent hires]
2. Teams will participate as stations - [interview 3 team leads]
3. 4-hour investment acceptable - [check with HR leadership]

### Integrated Synthesis

**The Vision:** Transform onboarding from passive information dump to active adventure where new hires explore the company, meet their future colleagues, and feel like heroes joining an important mission.

**The Path:** 6-week pilot program starting with Journey Passport concept, mobile companion app, and 8 station experiences. Begin with in-person, add virtual track in phase 2.

**The Safeguards:** Express track option preserves choice; pilot with 5 hires before full rollout; backup video content if live hosts unavailable; clear metrics (NPS, 90-day retention, time-to-productivity) to validate approach.
